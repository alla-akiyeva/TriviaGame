# Euro Quiz

Deployed version: https://alla-akiyeva.github.io/Crystal-Collector-Game/

This app demonstrates the use of JavaScript timers (`setTimeout, setInterval`) while testing the user's knowledge of European history and literature. 

### How it works

* The game shows one question at a time from a total of ten questions until the player answers it or until the time runs out.

* If the player selects the correct answer, a screen is displayed congratulating them for choosing the right option. After  seconds, display the next question -- with no user input required.

* The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs: 
* - If the player runs out of time, the app displays the correct answer and in a few secons, moves on to the next question.  

* - If the player chooses the wrong answer, the app displays the correct answer and in a few secons, moves on to the next question. 

* On the final screen, the game will show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
